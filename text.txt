Act 1

Ferrando
My Dorabella couldn't
Do such a thing:
Heaven made her
As faithful as she's fair.

Guglielmo
My Fiordiligi simply
Couldn't betray me:
I believe her constancy
Equals her beauty.

Don Alfonso
My hair is already grey,
I speak with authority;
But let's have done
With argument.

Ferrando and Guglielmo
No, you've told us
They could be faithless;
If you're honest
You will prove it.

Don Alfonso
Let's not trouble with proof.

Ferrando and Guglielmo
No, no, we demand it:
Or out with your sword
And we'll break up this friendship,

Don Alfonso
O what folly

Ferrando and Guglielmo
He strikes at my honour

Don Alfonso
O what folly

Ferrando and Guglielmo
He strikes at my honour
Who allows his lips
To utter a word
Which does her wrong.

Don Alfonso
O what folly
To try to discover
The wrong which will make us wretched
When we've found it!

Instrumental

Ferrando
A truce to your jests,
Or I swear, by heaven...

Don Alfonso
And I swear by this world,
My friends, I'm not jesting;
I'd only like to know
What kind of creatures
Are these beauties of yours,
if they're flesh and blood and bone like us,
If they eat like us, and wear skirts,
If, in fact, they're goddesses or women...

Ferrando and Guglielmo
They're women,
but the like of them...

Don Alfonso
And in woman you expect
To find fidelity?
How I love such simplicity!

Don Alfonso
Woman's constancy
Is like the Arabian Phoenix;
Everyone swears it exists,
But no one knows where.

Ferrando
The phoenix is my Dorabella!

Guglielmo
The phoenix is my Fiordiligi!

Ferrando and Guglielmo
Dorabella is the phoenix!
Fiordiligi is the phoenix!

Don Alfonso
It's neither one nor the other.
It never existed, and never will.
Woman's constancy
Is like the Arabian Phoenix;
Everyone swears it exists,
But no one knows where.

Ferrando
Poets' nonsense!

Guglielmo
Old men's drivel!

Don Alfonso
Well then, listen,
But without flying into a rage:
what if I prove conclusively to you today
That they're just like the others?

Guglielmo
It couldn't be!

Ferrando
Impossible!

Don Alfonso
Shall we bet on it?

Ferrando
We're on!

Don Alfonso
A hundred sequins.

Guglielmo
A thousand, if you like.

Don Alfonso
My hand on it!

Ferrando
Both hands!

Don Alfonso
Swear not to give a sign, a whisper,
A hint of all this
To your Penelopes.

Ferrando
We swear.

Don Alfonso
On your honour as soldiers?

Guglielmo
On our honour as soldiers.

Don Alfonso
And you'll do
Everything I tell you to?

Ferrando
Everything!

Guglielmo
Even more!

Don Alfonso
Well done!

Ferrando and Guglielmo
And well done,
Dear Don Alfonso!

Ferrando
We'll make merry at your expense.

Guglielmo
What shall we do with the hundred sequins?

Instrumental

Fiordiligi
Ah tell me sister,
Look!

Fiordiligi
If one could ever find
A nobler face, a sweeter mouth.

Dorabella
Just look,
See what fire is in his eye,
If flames and darts
Do not seem to flash forth!

Fiordiligi
This is the face
Of a soldier and a lover.

Dorabella
This is a face
Both charming and alarming.

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
How happy I am!

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
If ever my heart
Changes its affection,
May love make me
Live in pain.

Instrumental

Fiordiligi
This morning I feel in the mood
For some mischief: I've a fire,
A tingling in my veins.

Fiordiligi
There they are!

Dorabella
No, it's not them:
It's their friend Don Alfonso.

Fiordiligi
Welcome,
Don Alfonso!

Don Alfonso
Your servant!

Dorabella
What is it? Why are you alone?
You shed a tear? Speak, for pity's sake:
What has happened? My lover...

Dorabella
My dearest...

Don Alfonso
O cruel fate!

Don Alfonso
I would speak, but my courage fails,
My lips stammer.
I cannot say the words,
Which stay locked inside me.
What will you do? What shall I?
O dire misfortune!
It could not be worse.
I grieve for you and for them!

Fiordiligi
Mercy! For pity's sake,
Don Alfonso, do not torment us so.

Don Alfonso
You will need to summon
All your courage, my dears.

Dorabella
O heaven! What harm has befallen them?
What disaster?
Is my beloved killed?

Fiordiligi
Is mine dead?

Don Alfonso
No, not dead, but nearly as bad.

Dorabella
Wounded?

Don Alfonso
No.

Fiordiligi
Sick?

Don Alfonso
Not that either.

Fiordiligi
Well, what then?

Don Alfonso
The royal command has called them
To the battlefield.

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
Alas, what do I hear?

Fiordiligi
And they are going?

Don Alfonso
At once.
Come in, my friends!

Guglielmo
O Heaven, I feel my steps falter
In their progress towards you.

Ferrando
My trembling lips
Cannot utter the words.

Don Alfonso
In moments of the greatest stress
A hero calls up all his strength.

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
Now that we have heard the news,
One detail remains for you to do;
Be brave, and plunge your blade
Into this heart.

Ferrando and Guglielmo
My love, blame fate
If I must abandon you.

Dorabella
No, no, do not go!

Fiordiligi
Cruel one, do not leave me!

Dorabella
I would sooner tear my heart out!

Fiordiligi
I would sooner die at your feet!

Ferrando
What did I say?

Guglielmo
Do you see now?

Don Alfonso
Patience, friend;
We've not reached the end yet!

All
Thus destiny confounds
Our mortal hopes.

All
Ah who, amid such sorrow,
Can there ever be delight in life?

Ferrando
O heavens! That is the fatal drum 
That comes to tear me away!

Don Alfonso
Friends, here is the boat.

Fiordiligi
I'm fainting!

Dorabella
I'm dying!

Instrumental

Dorabella
Where are they?

Don Alfonso
They've gone.

Fiordiligi
Heaven grant it
A safe voyage!

Dorabella
May Heaven protect them too
On the field of battle!

Don Alfonso
Preserve your lovers
And my friends.

Fiordiligi, Dorabella and Don Alfonso
Gentle be the breeze,
Calm be the waves,
And every element
Smile in favour
On their wish.

Instrumental

Despina
What a wretched life
A lady's maid leads!
From morning till night working,
Sweating and toiling, and after all
One's done there's nothing for oneself!
Goodness, it's my ladies!

Despina
Here's your breakfast, ladies.

Despina
Jiminy! What are you doing?

Fiordiligi
Ah!

Dorabella
Ah!

Despina
What's happened?

Fiordiligi
Where is a dagger?
Where is the poison?

Despina
Ladies, I beg you!

Dorabella
Ah leave me! Flee the dread effect
Of a distracted love!
Close those windows; I hate the light,
I hate the air I breathe, I hate myself.
Who mocks at my grief? Who consoles me?
Ah fly; leave me alone, for pity's sake!

Dorabella
Implacable pangs
Which torment me,
Do not subside
Within my being
Until my anguish
Brings me death.
If I remain alive
I will furnish the Furies
With a wretched example
Of tragic love
With the dreadful sound
Of my sighs.

Blank

Despina
My lady Dorabella,
My lady Fiordiligi,
Tell me: what has happened?

Dorabella
O dreadful disaster!

Despina
Get on with it!

Fiordiligi
Our lovers
Have left Naples.

Despina
Is that all?
They'll be back.

Dorabella
Who knows!

Despina
What do you mean, who knows?
Where have they gone?

Dorabella
To the field of battle!

Despina
So much the better for them!

Fiordiligi
Fool, what are you saying?

Despina
There's lots more
Where he came from.

Dorabella
And do you believe anyone could love
Another man who once had had
A Guglielmo, a Ferrando for lover?

Despina
Certainly! And what's more,
Making love furiously, as your
Dear gentlemen will be doing on active service!

Dorabella
Don't insult those pure souls like this,
Those models of fidelity and perfect love.

Despina
Go on with you! The times are past
For spinning such tales even to babies!

Despina
You look for fidelity
In men, in soldiers?
Don't tell me that, for pity's sake!

Despina
All of them
Are made of the same stuff;
The quivering leaves,
The inconstant breezes
Have more stability
Than men.
Crocodile tears,
Lying looks,
Deceiving words,
False endearments
Are the basis
Of their tricks.
In us they only prize
Their own pleasure;
Then they despise us,
Deny us affection,
And from such tyrants
There's no mercy to be had.
We woman should pay out
This hurtful,
Impudent breed
In their own coin;
Let's love them
To suit our convenience and our vanity!
La ra la, la ra la, la ra la, la.
To suit our convenience and our vanity!

Instrumental

Don Alfonso
I present you, my friends,
To pretty Miss Despina;
The consolation of your heart
Lies in her hands alone.

Ferrando and Guglielmo
By those hands, which with joy I kiss,
By that smile so full of charm,
Make my treasure turn on me
Her clear and lovely eyes.

Despina
What sights! What clothes!
What faces! What moustaches!
I wonder what they are...
Wallachians or Turks.

Don Alfonso
What do you think of their appearance?

Despina
To be quite frank,
They're exceptional in their ugliness,
Enough to make one renounce love.

Ferrando, Guglielmo and Don Alfonso
Now the plan is quite decided;
If she doesn't recognise us,
There's no more need to fear.

Fiordiligi e Dorabella
Oh Despina! Despina!

Despina
The ladies!

Don Alfonso
Now's the moment!
Use your wits: I'll hide in here.

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
Impudent baggage!
What are you doing with those people?
Turn them out at once,
Or you'll be as sorry for it as they.

Despina, Ferrando and Guglielmo
Ah, ladies, pardon!
See at your lovely feet
Two wretches languishing,
Tortured with love by your beauty.

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
Great heavens! What do I hear?

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
Who was the shameless instigator
Of this vile betrayal?

Despina, Ferrando and Guglielmo
Pray calm your indignation!

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
I can contain myself no more!
My heart within my breast
Is filled with outrage
And with fear!

Despina and Don Alfonso
I'm a bit suspicious
Of this rage and fury!

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
Forgive me, beloved;
This heart of mine is innocent.

Ferrando and Guglielmo
What balm to this heart
Is all this rage and fury!

Instrumental

Fiordiligi
Begone, bold creatures! Leave this house!
And with the unwelcome breath of base words
Do not profane our hearts,
Our ears and our affections!
In vain do you, or others, seek to seduce
Our souls; the unsullied faith which
We plighted to our dear loves
We shall know bow to preserve for them
Until death, despite the world and fate.

Fiordiligi
Like a rock standing impervious
To winds and tempest,
So stands my heart ever strong
In faith and love.
Between us we have kindled
A flame which warms, and consoles us,
And death alone could
Change my heart's devotion.

Blank

Fiordiligi
Respect this example
Of constancy, you abject creatures,
And do not let a base hope
Make you so rash again!

Don Alfonso
And may I ask to know
The reason for this laughter?

Guglielmo
Oh what a face! Don't you think,
my dear sir, that we have good cause?

Don Alfonso
Before evening
We'll talk of this.

Ferrando
Whenever you like.

Don Alfonso
Meanwhile, silence and obedience.
Until tomorrow morning.

Guglielmo
We are soldiers
And accept discipline.

Don Alfonso
Very well: both of you go
And wait for me in the garden:
There I'll give you your orders.

Guglielmo
But don't we eat today?

Ferrando
What's it matter?
When the battle's over
Our supper will taste the better.

Ferrando
A breath of love
From our treasures
Will afford our hearts
Sweet sustenance.
A breath of love
From our treasures
Will afford our hearts
Sweet sustenance.
A heart nourished
On the hope of love
Has no need
Of greater inducement.

Blank

Don Alfonso
It's quite absurd! There are
So few constant women in this world,
And here are two of them!
It can't be.
Come here, and tell me
Where your mistresses are and what they're doing.

Despina
The poor fools
Are standing in the garden
Bewailing the loss of their lovers
To the breezes and the mosquitos.

Don Alfonso
And how do you think
This will end?
Can we hope
They'll come to their senses?

Despina
Leave me the bother
Of running the show.
When Despina runs something
It can't fail: I've already led
A thousand men by the nose:
I should know how to manage two women.
Are your two whiskered monsieurs rich?

Don Alfonso
Rolling in it.

Despina
Where are they?

Don Alfonso
In the street,
Waiting for me.

Despina
Then off you go
And bring them to me here
By the little door;
I'll wait for you in my room.
If you'll do all I tell you,
Before tomorrow your friends
Will win the day: they'll have their way,
And I'll have the glory.

Instrumental

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
Ah, how my lot has changed
All in a moment!
Ah, what a sea of torment
Is life henceforth for me!
So long as the cruel stars
Left my dear one with me,
I knew not what grief was,
I knew not what it was to pine.
Ah, how my lot has changed
All in a moment!
Ah, what a sea of torment
Is life henceforth for me!

Ferrando and Guglielmo
Let us die, yes, let us die
And thus melt their hard hearts.

Don Alfonso
There is yet a hope:
I beg you, do not do it!

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
Goodness, what terrible cries!

Ferrando and Guglielmo
Let me be!

Don Alfonso
Wait!

Ferrando and Guglielmo
May arsenic set me free
From such cruelty!

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
Heavens, was that poison?

Don Alfonso
Poison good and proper

Don Alfonso
That in a few moments
Will deprive them of their lives!

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
The tragic sight
Turns my heart to ice.

Ferrando and Guglielmo
Draw near, cruel ones;
See the dire effect
Of despairing love
And at least pity us.

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
The tragic sight
Turns my heart to ice.

All
May the sun's rays
Be darkened for me!

All
Trembling: the very fibres
Of my being failing,
And my tongue and lips
Cannot form a word.

Don Alfonso
Since these unfortunates
Are near to death,
At least try to show them
A little pity.

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
Help, someone, come quickly
O Heaven, can no one hear!
Despina!

Despina
Did someone call?

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
Despina!

Despina
What do I see?

Despina
I fear the poor things are dead,
Or very near to dying!

Don Alfonso
Alas, only too true!
Distraught, despairing,
They have taken poison!
Oh strange love!

Despina
It would be shameful of you
To forsake these unhappy wretches.
You must aid them.

Fiordiligi, Dorabella and Don Alfonso
Whatever can we do?

Despina
They still show signs of life;
Give them a little comfort
From your kindly hands.
(To Alfonso) You hurry away with me
And we'll seek
A doctor and an antidote.

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
God, no more dreadful situation
Could ever be imagined!

Ferrando and Guglielmo
No more farcical comedy
Could ever be imagined!

Ferrando and Guglielmo
Ah!

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
The poor dears are sighing!

Fiordiligi
What shall we do?

Dorabella
You suggest something.

Fiordiligi
At a moment so painful
Who could forsake them?

Dorabella
Their faces are quite interesting!

Fiordiligi
We could go a little further.

Dorabella
His head is very cold.

Fiordiligi
This one's cold as ice.

Dorabella
And his pulse?

Fiordiligi
I can't feel it.

Dorabella
This one's beating very slowly.

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
Oh, if help is long in coming,
There'll be no more hope of life!

Ferrando and Guglielmo
Both have become
Calmer and more gentle;
We shall see if their pity
Will turn into love.

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
Poor dears! Their death
Would fill me with grief.

Don Alfonso
Here's the doctor,
Gentle ladies!

Ferrando and Guglielmo
Despina dressed up!
How heavily she's disguised!

Despina
Salvete, amabiles
Buonae puellae!

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
He speaks a language
We do not understand.

Despina
Let's speak, then,
As you command me.
I know Greek and Arabic,
Turkish and the Vandal tongue;
And I can speak
Swabian and Tartar too.

Don Alfonso
Keep all these languages
For yourself, sir;
For the moment,
Look at these poor fellows;
They've taken poison;
What can be done?

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
Yes, doctor,
What can be done?

Despina
First I must know
The nature of this potion
And the reason it was taken;
Whether it was swallowed
Hot or cold,
A little or a lot,
In one draught
Or in several.

Fiordiligi, Dorabella and Don Alfonso
They took arsenic,
Good doctor,
And drank it here.
The cause was love
And they swallowed it
In a single gulp.

Despina
Don't worry,
Don't be afraid;
Here is an earnest
Of my skill.

Fiordiligi, Dorabella and Don Alfonso
He's taken a piece
Of iron in his hand.

Despina
This is a piece of magnet,
The stone which the great
Doctor Mesmer discovered
In Germany
And then became
So famous in France.

Instrumental

Fiordiligi, Dorabella and Don Alfonso
Look, they're moving,
Twisting, shaking!
They'll hit their heads
On the ground in a moment.

Despina
Ah, hold their foreheads
Steady, will you?

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
We're standing ready!

Despina
Hold tight!
Courage!
Now they
Are safe from death.

Fiordiligi, Dorabella and Don Alfonso
They're looking round
And recovering their strength.
Ah, this doctor's
Worth all the gold in Peru!

Ferrando and Guglielmo
Where am I? What place is this?
Who is he? Who are they?
Am I before Jove's throne?
Are you Pallas or Cytherea?
No, you are my fair goddess!
I recognise you by that sweet face,
And by that hand I now know so well;
It is my only treasure.

Despina and Don Alfonso
It's the effect of the poison still;
Don't be afraid.

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
That may be so, but such liberties
Do violence to our reputation.

Ferrando and Guglielmo
I beg you, my adored one,
Turn your lovely eyes on me.

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
I can resist no longer!

Blank

Ferrando and Guglielmo
Give me a kiss, my treasure,
One single kiss, or else I die.

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
Heavens, a kiss?

Despina
Agree,
As an act of kindness!

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
This is too much to ask
Of a chaste and faithful woman!
It's an outrage to my love,
It's an outrage to my heart!

Despina, Ferrando, Guglielmo and Don Alfonso
A more amusing picture
Can't be found in all the world;
That which makes me laugh the most
Is their rage and fury.

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
Despairing or poisoned,
Go to the devil,
Truly you'll repent too late
If you anger me more!

Despina and Don Alfonso
I don't know if their rage
And fury are feigned or real,
But wouldn't wish this fire
To end in the fire of love.
I know full well this fire
Will change to that of love.

Ferrando and Guglielmo
I don't know if their rage
And fury are feigned or real,
But wouldn't wish this fire
To end in the fire of love.
I know full well this fire
Will change to that of love.

Act 2

Despina
Upon my word, you're
The strangest pair of creatures!

Fiordiligi
You jade!
What are you after?

Despina
For me, nothing.

Fiordiligi
For whom, then?

Despina
For you.

Dorabella
For us?

Despina
For you:
Are you women or not?

Fiordiligi
What do you mean?

Despina
I mean,
You should act like women, then.

Dorabella
And how is that?

Despina
For example, your gallants
Have gone off to the wars: till they return,
Act like the army: go recruiting!

Fiordiligi
Indeed, you'd have us
Acting very strangely.
Do you think we want to be
The talk of all the gossips?
Do you think we want to cause
Such anguish to our loved ones?

Despina
And who says
You'd be doing them any harm?

Dorabella
Don't you consider
It would be harm enough
If word got round
That we were entertaining them?

Despina
As for that, there's
A perfectly safe method;
I'll spread it abroad
That they're after me.

Dorabella
Who'd believe that?

Despina
Oh thank you! Hasn't a maid
The right to have a couple of followers?
You can trust in me.

Dorabella
And then?

Despina
And then?
Bless us, get on with it.
I said they'd fall!

Fiordiligi
What should we do?

Despina
Whatever you want.
Are you flesh and blood,
Or what?

Despina
At fifteen a woman
Should know the ways of the world,
Where the devil keeps his tail,
What's right and what is wrong.
She should know the wiles
That ensnare lovers,
How to feign laughter or tears
And to make up good excuses.
At one and the same moment
She must listen to a hundred
But speak with her eyes
To a thousand,
Hold out hope to all,
Be they handsome or plain,
Know how to hide things
Without getting flustered,
Know how to tell lies
Without ever blushing.
And, like a queen
On her lofty throne,
Get her own way
With “I can” and “I will”
And, like a queen
Get her own way
It seems they're taking
To this doctrine;
Hooray for Despina,
She knows how to do it.

Blank

Fiordiligi
Sister, what do you say?

Dorabella
I'm dumbfounded
At the fiendish ideas of that girl.

Fiordiligi
Believe me, she's crazy. Do you think 
We could possibly follow her counsel?

Dorabella
Of course, if you stood everything
Upside down.

Fiordiligi
On the contrary, I'm standing things
The right way up:
Don't you think it wrong
For two young women who are betrothed
To do such things?

Dorabella
She's not saying
We should do any harm.

Fiordiligi
It' bad enough
Getting ourselves talked about!

Dorabella
But if it's said
They've come to see Despina!

Fiordiligi
Your conscience is too elastic!
What will our menfolk say?

Dorabella
Nothing; either they'll not know about it
And it's over and done with,
Or they'll hear something,
And then we'll say
They came to see her.

Fiordiligi
But our hearts?

Dorabella
Will stay as they are;
To amuse ourselves a little
And not to die of boredom
My dear sister.

Fiordiligi
That's true.

Dorabella
So?

Fiordiligi
So you go ahead:

Fiordiligi
But I don't want to be involved
If there should be a scandal.

Dorabella
How can there be a scandal
When we're taking such precautions?
However, listen, let's come to an agreement:
Which of these two do you fancy for yourself?

Fiordiligi
You choose, sister.

Dorabella
I've already chosen.

Dorabella
I'll take the dark one,
Who seems to me more fun.

Fiordiligi
And meantime I'll laugh
And joke a bit with the fair one.

Dorabella
Playfully I'll answer
His sweet words.

Fiordiligi
Sighing, I'll imitate
The other's sighs.

Dorabella
He'll say to me:
My love, I'm dying!

Fiordiligi
He'll say to me:
My dearest treasure!

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
And meanwhile

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
What sport and pleasure
I shall have!

Blank

Fiordiligi
What a lovely day!

Ferrando
Perhaps a trifle hot.

Dorabella
What pretty bushes!

Guglielmo
Yes, yes, very pretty;
They've more leaves than fruit.

Fiordiligi
How charming these paths are!
Shall we take a stroll?

Ferrando
Your slightest wish
Is my command.

Fiordiligi
You are too kind!

Ferrando
This is the big moment!

Fiordiligi
What did you say to him?

Ferrando
Er... I told him
To keep her entertained.

Dorabella
Let us go for a stroll too.

Guglielmo
Just as you please.

Guglielmo
Oh dear!

Dorabella
What's the matter?

Guglielmo
I feel so bad,
My dearest one,
That I think I'm going to die.

Dorabella
This simply won't do.

Dorabella
It'll be the after effects
Of the poison that you drank.

Guglielmo
Ah, I drink in
A far stronger poison
From the cruel, fiery
Volcanoes of love!

Dorabella
It'll be a burning poison;
Cool yourself a little.

Guglielmo
Unkind one, you mock me
While I'm dying.
They've vanished;
Where the devil have they got to?

Dorabella
Oh, don't do that.

Guglielmo
I'm dying, cruel one, and you mock me?

Dorabella
I mock you?

Guglielmo
Then give me, light of my life,
Some token of your pity.

Dorabella
Two, if you like.
Tell me what you'd have, and we'll see.

Guglielmo
Is she joking or in earnest?

Guglielmo
Deign to accept
This humble offering.

Dorabella
A heart?

Guglielmo
Yes, a heart; the symbol of that one
Which burns, pines and longs for you.

Dorabella
What a precious gift!

Guglielmo
Will you accept it?

Dorabella
Cruel man,
Do not seek to tempt a faithful heart.

Guglielmo
The mountain is weakening. I don't like this,
But I've pledged my honour as a soldier.
I adore you!

Dorabella
I beg of you!

Guglielmo
I am all yours!

Dorabella
O Heavens!

Guglielmo
Give in, my dear one!

Dorabella
You'll drive me to my death!

Guglielmo
We'll die together then,
My hope and love.
Will you accept it?

Dorabella
I accept.

Guglielmo
Poor Ferrando!
Oh what joy!

Guglielmo
This heart I give you,
My adored one;
But I want yours in return;
Come, give it me.

Dorabella
You've given it and I take it,
But mine I cannot give;
In vain you ask it of me,
It is no longer mine.

Guglielmo
If you no longer own it,
Why does it beat here?

Dorabella
If you gave me it,
What is still beating there?

Guglielmo
Why does it beat here?

Dorabella
What is still beating there?

Dorabella and Guglielmo
Why is it beating?

Dorabella and Guglielmo
It is my own dear heart
That is no longer mine;
It's come to lodge with you!

Dorabella and Guglielmo
And that's what's beating so.

Guglielmo
Let me put it here.

Dorabella
There it cannot stay.

Guglielmo
I understand, you little rogue.

Dorabella
What are you doing?

Guglielmo
You're not to look.

Dorabella
I feel I have
A volcano in my bosom!

Guglielmo
Poor Ferrando!
It doesn't seem possible.
Now turn your pretty eyes on me.

Dorabella
What do you want?

Guglielmo
See,
Doesn't that look better?

Dorabella and Guglielmo
Oh happy exchange
Of hearts and affections!
What new delights!
What sweet pain!

Ferrando
We've won, my boy!

Guglielmo
Two of a kind?

Ferrando
A straight flush!
Fiordiligi is modesty incarnate.
She was keeping herself pure as a dove
For her dear Guglielmo:
Haughtily she repulsed me,
Upbraided me, fled me,
Giving me evidence and proof
That she's a woman without equal.

Guglielmo
Good for you, good for me,
Good for my Penelope!
Let me embrace you
For your happy tidings,
My faithful Mercury!

Ferrando
And my Dorabella,
How did she behave?
Oh, I haven't a doubt of her.
I know so well her sensitive soul.

Guglielmo
Well, just between ourselves,
Maybe doubt is not such a bad thing.

Ferrando
What?

Guglielmo
Oh, don't take me seriously.
I'd like to gild the pill for him.

Ferrando
Speak out! Did she perhaps
Fall for your flatteries?
Ah, if I could even suspect it!

Guglielmo
In this world
It's always wise to be a bit suspicious.

Ferrando
Ye immortal gods! Speak out!
Don't roast me on a slow fire;
But no, you're making sport of me;
She loves me, adores me alone.

Guglielmo
Certainly! And so in proof
Of her love and devotion
She gave me this little picture.

Ferrando
My portrait!
The traitress!

Guglielmo
Where are you going?

Ferrando
To tear her heart from her wicked bosom
And avenge the betrayal of my love.

Guglielmo
Stop!

Ferrando
No, let me go!

Guglielmo
Are you crazy? Would you ruin yourself
For a worthless woman?
I wouldn't want him
To commit some folly!

Ferrando
Ye gods! All those promises,
And tears, and sighs, and vows
How could the inhuman creature
Forget them so soon?

Guglielmo
I'm sure I don't know.

Ferrando
What should I do now?
What plan apply myself?

Ferrando
Take pity on me!
Give me your counsel!

Guglielmo
My friend, I don't know
How to advise you.

Ferrando
Cruel! Heartless
In a day! In a few hours!

Guglielmo
It's certainly something to wonder at.

Instrumental

Guglielmo
Ladies, you treat so many thus
That, if I must speak the truth,
I begin to sympathise
When your lovers complain.
I adore the sex, you know,
Everyone knows it;
Each day I show it
And always take your part.
But such treatment of so many
Discourages me, in truth.
A thousand times I've drawn my sword
To defend your honour.
A thousand times I've championed you
With my tongue and with my heart.
But such treatment of so many
Is pernicious and a bore.
You're attractive, you are charming,
Heaven has given you treasures galore
And graces envelop you
From head to foot.
But thus you treat so many,
That it's difficult to believe,
A thousand times I've drawn my sword
Defended your treasures in heaven
But thus you treat so many,
That it's difficult to believe,
And if your lovers complain
They have good reason indeed.

Guglielmo
Why?

Guglielmo
They have good reason indeed.

Guglielmo
Why?

Guglielmo
They have good reason indeed.

Instrumental

Ferrando
In what fierce strife, in what confusion
Of thoughts and affections I find myself!
So unusual and novel is my situation
I do not know what to do... 
Oh, Alfonso, how you must be laughing
At my stupidity!
But I'll be revenged, I'll banish
The traitress from my mind...
Banish her?

Ferrando
O Heaven, too loudly my heart
Intercedes for her.

Ferrando
Betrayed

Ferrando
Scorned

Ferrando
By her faithless heart!

Ferrando
I still know
That my soul adores her,
I still hear
The voice of love for her.

Ferrando
Betrayed

Ferrando
Scorned

Ferrando
By her faithless heart!

Ferrando
I still know
That my soul adores her,
I still hear
The voice of love for her.

Fiordiligi
How everything conspires to tempt my heart!
But no! Let me die rather than yield!
My eyes must not fall on him again!
I'll threaten all the servants with dismissal.
In the house are several uniforms
Of Guglielmo's and Ferrando's: courage now!
Despina! Despina!

Despina
What is it?

Fiordiligi
Take this key, and without any questions
Or any back answers, go to the wardrobe
Bring me two swords, two helmets and
Two tunics of our lovers.

Despina
Very good, ma'am.
I think she's out of her mind.

Fiordiligi
Ferrando's uniform will fit me;
Dorabella can take Guglielmo's.
In these outfits
We'll join our sweethearts,
We can fight beside them
And die, if need be.

Fiordiligi
Very soon now I'll be enfolded
In the embraces of my true love;
Unrecognised in these garments
I will come before him.
Oh, what joy will fill his heart
When he sees me again!

Ferrando
And meanwhile I, left wretched,
Shall die of grief.

Fiordiligi
What do I see? I am betrayed!
Oh leave me!

Ferrando
Ah no, dear heart!
With this sword in your hand
Strike me to the heart,
And if you lack the strength,
I'll guide your hand myself.

Fiordiligi
Alas, be silent! I am
Tormented and unhappy enough!

Fiordiligi and Ferrando
Ah, now my constancy begins to falter
Before his looks and his words!

Fiordiligi
Get up, I beg!

Ferrando
It cannot be.

Fiordiligi
In pity's name, what do you ask of me?

Ferrando
Your heart or my death.

Fiordiligi
My strength is giving out!

Ferrando
Yield, my dearest!

Fiordiligi
Heaven, direct me!

Ferrando
Yield, my dearest!

Fiordiligi
Heaven, direct me!

Ferrando
Turn a merciful eye on me.
In me alone you'll find
Husband, lover and more, if you wish.
Delay no longer, my adored one.

Fiordiligi
Merciful heaven! Cruel man, you've won!
Do with me what you will.

Blank

Ferrando and Fiordiligi
Embrace me, my dearest,
And may the consolation for our sorrows
Be to spend our time in sweet affection,
And sigh for joy!

Instrumental

Guglielmo
Alas, poor me, what have I seen!
What have I heard!

Don Alfonso
Keep quiet, for heaven's sake!

Guglielmo
I'll pluck out my beard,
I'll tear my flesh,
And charge the stars with my horns!
So that was Fiordiligi, my Penelope,
The chaste Diana of the age! Strumpet,
Assassin, cheat, swindler, bitch!

Don Alfonso
Let him get it off his chest.

Ferrando
Well!

Guglielmo
Where is she?

Ferrando
Who? Your Fiordiligi?

Guglielmo
My Fior... Furies of hell!
Strangle first her and then me!

Ferrando
You see now; there are distinctions;
There's a little extra something...

Guglielmo
Stop it! Stop
Taunting me,
Let's find a way
Of punishing them soundly.

Don Alfonso
I know what to do: marry them.

Guglielmo
I'd rather marry
Charon's boat.

Ferrando
Vulcan's smithy.

Guglielmo
The gates of hell.

Don Alfonso
Then you'll stay bachelors for ever.

Ferrando
Are there no women
Fit for men like us?

Don Alfonso
There's not so many.
But what would they do,
If these act like this?
At bottom, you still
Love these plucked birds.

Guglielmo
Alas, it's true!

Ferrando
Too true!

Don Alfonso
Well then, take them as they are.

Don Alfonso
Meanwhile listen to my song:
Take heed, and you'll be happy.

Don Alfonso
Everyone blames women, but I forgive them
If they change their love a thousand times a day;
Some call it a sin, others a habit,
But I say it's a necessity of their heart.
The lover who finds that he's been deceived
Should blame not others but his own mistake;
Whether they're young or old, fair or plain –

Don Alfonso
Repeat with me:
Women are all the same!

Instrumental

Ferrando and Guglielmo
Everything now, my dearest,
Accords with my desires.

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
Joy grows and spreads
Throughout my veins.

Ferrando and Guglielmo
You are so beautiful!

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
You are so handsome!

Ferrando and Guglielmo
What lovely eyes!

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
What an attractive mouth!

Ferrando and Guglielmo
Clink glasses and drink!

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
Drink and clink glasses!

Fiordiligi, Dorabella and Ferrando
In your glass and mine
May every care be drowned,
And let no memory of the past
Remain in our hearts.

Guglielmo
Would that they were drinking poison,
The dishonourable jades!

Instrumental

Fiordiligi, Dorabella, Despina, Ferrando and Guglielmo
What's that noise? What's that music?

Don Alfonso
Keep quiet: I'll go and see.

Don Alfonso
Mercy on us!
God in heaven!
Disaster is upon us!
I tremble! My blood runs cold!
Your former lovers...

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
My former lover...

Don Alfonso
Are returning, oh heaven,
At this moment,
And are now disembarking
On the shore!

Fiordiligi, Dorabella, Ferrando and Guglielmo
What do I hear?
Ye cruel stars!
What's to be done
At this dire moment?

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
Go at once,

Ferrando, Guglielmo, Despina and Don Alfonso
Suppose they see us (them)?

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
Quickly, fly;

Ferrando, Guglielmo, Despina and Don Alfonso
Suppose we (they) meet them?

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
Conceal yourselves,
For pity's sake!
Heaven, help us!

Don Alfonso
Be reassured,

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
Heaven, guide us!

Don Alfonso
Keep calm,

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
Who will save us
From this peril?

Don Alfonso
Trust in me,
And all will be well.

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
A thousand cruel thoughts
Are tormenting my heart;
If they discover the deception
Whatever will become of us?

Ferrando and Guglielmo
Safe and sound, exulting with joy,
We return to the loving embrace
Of our faithful sweethearts
To crown them for their constancy!

Don Alfonso
Great heaven! Guglielmo! Ferrando!
What joy! You here? How and when?

Ferrando and Guglielmo
Recalled by royal countermand,
Our hearts full of contentment and joy,
We've returned to our adorable sweethearts,
We've returned to your friendship.

Guglielmo
But why this pallor, this silence?

Ferrando
Why is my love so sad?

Don Alfonso
Their tongues are tied
With confusion and overwhelming joy.

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
My tongue has forsaken me;
If I don't die it will be a miracle.

Guglielmo
Allow me to have
This trunk brought into that room.
Heavens, what do I see!

Guglielmo
A jacket here!
It’s not mine! What's this doing here?

Ferrando and Guglielmo
Merciful heaven! Who else is here,
Don't try to deny it!
Treachery, treachery!
Let us find the villains
And their blood shall flow
In torrents, rivers, oceans!

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
Ah, my love, my sin is mortal
And death alone I seek now;
Too late I see my error;
With your sword pierce this bosom
That deserves no pity!

Ferrando and Guglielmo
Tell us all.

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
Let them speak for us,
That pander and that procuress!

Don Alfonso
Too true is what she says,
And the proof is shut in there!

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
I freeze, I shiver with fright;
Why did he give them away?

Ferrando
Lovely lady, a noble of Albania
Bows before you!

Guglielmo
The miniature
Exchanged for the little heart
I return herewith,
Madame!

Ferrando and Guglielmo
And to the magnetic doctor
I give the honour
Which he merited!

Fiordiligi, Dorabella and Despina
Heavens, what do I see?

Ferrando, Guglielmo and Don Alfonso
They're stupefied!

Fiordiligi, Dorabella and Despina
I cannot bear this torment!

Ferrando, Guglielmo and Don Alfonso
They're half crazy!

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
That is the cruel man
Who deceived us!

Don Alfonso
I deceived you, but my deception
Undeceived your lovers,
Who henceforth will be wiser
And will do as I wish.
Give me your hands, now you're united.
Embrace each other and say no more.
All four of you can laugh now
As I have laughed and shall do again.

Fiordiligi and Dorabella
My love, if this is true,
With fidelity and with love
I will make good what I have done
And adore you evermore.

Ferrando and Guglielmo
I believe you, my fair one,
But I won't put it to the test.

Despina
I don't know if I'm awake or dreaming,
I'm confused, I feel ashamed;
I'm slipping badly if they can do to me
What I have done to many others.

All
Happy is the man who looks
At everything on the right side
And through trials and tribulations
Makes reason his guide.
What always makes another weep
Will be for him a cause of mirth
And amid the tempests of this world
He will find sweet peace!
